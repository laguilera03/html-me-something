                <p>I started out in my little Porsche Boxster out of Miami. No GPS was needed since I drove on the I-95 heading North for 500 miles. Along the way, I met an old middle school buddy for lunch in Orlando, FL. I also passed by Jacksonville, FL where I hit traffic.</p>

                <p>After 10 hours of driving, I stopped in Savannah, GA. My friends from Hunter AAF, GA received me the "Southern Hospitality. I rested and the next day was greated with breakfast before heading to Tybee Beach to ride bike and dip in the ocean.</p>
                <h1>Checkpoints: Washington, DC </h1>

                <p>I continued heading North on I-95. In three hours, I stopped by Fayetville, NC to visit a battle buddy from basic in Fort Bragg to eat lunch and refuel. Thereon after, I drove non-stop, only for fuel, until arrriving at Washington, DC where I met my friend from Basic Officer Leaders Course. We shared beers and stories at his place, right across the river from the National Mall.

                <p>After resting all day and walking the National Mall in evening, I was ready to drive another 500 miles to arrive at Cape Cod, MA. On the I-95, I got screwed with tolls in New Jersey and the Washington Brridge entering New York. I ate snacks such as sun flower seeds and red bull to stay awake because I started falling behind schedule. On the morning of the 4th day, I finally made it to Cape Cod, MA. My childhood friend from Miami and his new family greeted me at their place in U.S. Coast Guard Base Cape Cod, just in time to help them to move. &#128528</p>
